# Getting Started with Create React App - Test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run deploy`

This will build and deploy the application to github pages.  After deployment finishes, a Github Action runs to actually deploy the application.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Components

### Setup

Initial page used to maintain a list of games and to create new `event`s 

### UserList

Main purpose is to build and display the current list of users for this `event`
Currently also responsible for displaying `UserPointsBarchart` and `GameSelectionWithPoints`

### UserPointsBarchart

Sole purpose is to display the barchart that shows point distribution across games.  Replies entirely on UserList feeding in this data (points data, games data, and users data)

### GameSelectionWithPoints

Displays the list of games available for the event, lets current user clear their points as well as assign points to games

### DisplayNamePrompt

Prompts user for a display name, communicates name back through callback provided to constructor

### GameChoosingPage

Responsible for initial routing when user lands on `../{eventCode}` url
Calls DisplayNamePrompt to see if, and prompt for if we don't, have a displayName
Once it has a displayName, it shows the UserList
